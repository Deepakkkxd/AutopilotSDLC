1. Why This Can Win
Highly Relevant: DevOps + AI is trending — shows real-world value.

Multi-Agent Complexity: Shows deep orchestration of ADK agents.

Google Ecosystem Integration: Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Vertex AI, BigQuery (optional) — check.

Clear Demo Value: Judges can see each step automated in the 3-min demo.

Scalable: Can be extended beyond hackathon — real startup potential.

2. What it Does
A fully autonomous multi-agent system that:

Takes a product idea

Creates epics and tasks

Writes and reviews code

Runs tests

Deploys to a staging environment

3. 🤖 Agents
Agent	Role
🧠 Planner Agent	Breaks down product idea into epics & GitHub issues
💻 Coder Agent	Writes code for a selected task
👀 Reviewer Agent	Reviews code, flags errors, suggests improvements
🧪 Test Agent	Generates and runs unit tests
🚀 DevOps Agent	Uses Cloud Build + Cloud Run to deploy app
📊 Report Agent	Compiles a final report and deployment status

Agents communicate using ADK, and external tasks are orchestrated using Google Cloud APIs (e.g., Cloud Run, GitHub API, GCP SDK).

4. Tech Stack
Layer	Tech
🧠 Agents	Agent Development Kit (ADK), Python
🌐 UI (Optional)	Next.js + Tailwind CSS
🧠 LLM	Gemini Pro or Vertex AI
☁️ Cloud	Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Firestore or Cloud Storage
🧪 Code/Test Gen	Gemini + custom prompt templates
🔧 Infra Mgmt	GitHub Actions, gcloud SDK
